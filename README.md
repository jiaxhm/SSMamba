# SSMamba: Superpixel Segmentation with Mamba

Abstract—Deep convolutional networks have achieved remark
able success in superpixel segmentation. However, they only focus
 on local features ignoring global attributes. The visual Mamba
 demonstrates an exceptional capability to capture long-range
 dependencies and offers a lower computational cost compared
 to the Transformer. Building on this inspiration, we propose a
 novel superpixel segmentation with Mamba, termed SSMamba.
 In SSMamba, Mamba is integrated into a global-local archi
tecture, enabling efficient interaction between global attributes
 and local features to produce high-quality superpixels. The
 designed activation function further enhances the effectiveness
 of SSMamba. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSMamba
 achieves superior performance on multiple public datasets, in
 terms of quantitative metric and visual comparison.
